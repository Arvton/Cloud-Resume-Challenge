# Cloud-Resume-Challenge
A 16 step challenge to host your resume on the cloud and show experience working in the cloud. For my challenge, I will be building out the project on Azure to leverage the knowledge I've gained by going through Azure certifications (my credly account: https://www.credly.com/users/arvin-josol/badges).
